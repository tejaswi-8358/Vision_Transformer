ABSTRACT

Vision Transformers have emerged as a groundbreaking approach to computer vision tasks, particularly in image classification. The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a neural network architecture introduced for computer vision tasks, challenging the conventional use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). ViT leverages the Transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to process images in a holistic manner. Unlike traditional CNNs that operate on local image patches, ViT treats the entire image as a sequence of tokens, where each token corresponds to a non-overlapping image patch.
The core idea behind ViT is to utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies and relationships between different parts of the image. The model consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward layers, allowing it to learn hierarchical representations. To adapt the Transformer architecture for image data, ViT incorporates a learnable positional embedding to preserve spatial information.
This project aims to implement a Vision Transformer model using TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on the CIFAR-10 dataset. By treating images as sequences of patches and leveraging the transformer architecture, ViTs demonstrate a novel way to capture both local and global information efficiently. The objective is to develop a robust image classification model, assess its performance, and explore the potential advantages of Vision Transformers over traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
